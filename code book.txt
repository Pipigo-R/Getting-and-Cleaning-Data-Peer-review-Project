Input datasets (.txt format)
	README.txt
	features_info.txt --- Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
	features.txt ---- 561 obs with 2 variables, list all 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
	activity_label.txt --- 6 obs with 2 variables, class labels with their activity name.
	test/x_test.txt ---- test set (2947 Obs with 561 variables)
	test/y_test.txt ---- test label (2947 Obs with 1 variable)
        test/subject_test ---- identifies the subject who performed the activity for test (2947 Obs with 1 variable)
	train/x_train.txt ---- train set (7352 Obs with 561 varaibles)
	train/y_train.txt ---- train label (7352 Obs with 1 varaible)
        train/subject_train ---- identifies the subject who performed the activity for train (7352 Obs with 1 varaible)

Part 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	appending rows in x_test and x_train as X with rbind() --- (2947 + 7352 = 10299 Obs and 561 variables)
        appending rows in y_test and y_train as Y with rbind() --- (2947 + 7352 = 10299 Obs and 1 variable)
        appending rows in subject_test and subject_train as subject with rbind() --- (2947 + 7352 = 10299 Obs and 1 variable)
        merge X, Y, subject as one dataset All_Data (10299 Obs and 563 variables)
        
Part 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	generate ExtData only include measurements for mean and std by select only variables name contains "mean" or "std"--- (10299 Obs and 88 variables)

Part 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	apply name of activity in data activity_labels for code. and name variable as "activity"

Part 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	Give the variable names with meanning: 
		acc --- Accelerometer
		gyo --- Gyroscope
		t (beginning of the name) ---- Time
                f (beginning of the name) ---- Frequency
		mag --- Magnitude
		bodybody --- Body
	
Part 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.	
	generate OutputData by gen average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
	(180 Obs and 88 variables)
	output to "OutputData.txt"
